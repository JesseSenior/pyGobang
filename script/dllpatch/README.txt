Due to compatibility issues between Nuitka and pygame, some DLL files are not included correctly (see https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/1510). 

This folder is used to store the missing DLL files to ensure the built binaries running properly.

If the issue is resolved, the folder should no longer be used!
